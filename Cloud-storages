Cloud storage/object storage
Type of Cloud storage
Standard Storage      Nearline storage    coldlinestorage    Archive Storage

standard storage details
Hot storage like the data that can retive or access on daily base or frequently use standard storage
low latency
high durability like 99.999999999 or 99.95
fast reliable
less data retrival time
regional service is redunent means its repica or object will remain in the same region
best is to chose dual-region or multi-region it means its replica will save in other region for high availability and fault tolernace.

Nearline storage:
1:it is low cost storage as compared to standard storage
2:nearline storage use where data can be access infrequently
3: data can be  access from min month not later
4:This storage can be use one or two time if use more retrival cost may effect.
5: durability like 99.90% all other stoage have the same level of durabiltiy.

Coldline-Storage
Coldline storage is also high avalable and infrequent access of data
mean data can access after three month or max six month a once.
Archive Data storage:
Turbo-replication:
Turbo-replication is a advance feature to replicate from one bucket to other with second ascyncronsly 
storage bucket policy Types:
Uniform:
have same policy on all the object of the bucket.
Fined-grain
have diff policy base on policy type what kind of policy type want to implement on the object inshort we can set diff access ploicy for diff object in the same buckt
by default policy is unform.

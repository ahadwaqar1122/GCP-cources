features           1:Standard                                  2: flexible
statup                 seconds                                   minuts

Write to local disk     no(cannot access app-engin 
                           resources write to local disk)        yes(can access app engine resourecs
                                                                    like ephemrial storage mean inistlized when resource instlized)
need of vpc            No                                        yes
prices               free daily use also resoure limitation      pay for resource allocation per hours

scale to zero          if no user no scal but if request come     one instance run in the backend always
                      it will take time so high latency          no latency

                      
  scale             two tier frontend and bankend                manual and Automatic scaling
                        frontend ---automatic scaling            use containerized environment
                         backed-----manul and basic scaling
                        use sandbox environment
  languages            support limetd languages                  support diff languages

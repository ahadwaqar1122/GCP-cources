 vm type on GCP
 custom machine
 we can create vm according to our need like its cpu and ram as per our need we can select
predefined Machine
but in predefined we can chose given formate that is best close to our need we can not go minimum limit of scope
predefind GCE family or types
General Purpose---------types
E2   day-to-day computing a lower cost
N1/N2/N2D   balanced price and performace accorss wide range of vm shapes

compute optimized
GCP use KVM hyperviser having linux base karnel 
local SSD like aws instance store that is like temporary storage remove when stop vm so aviad long term data storage,its is also called direct attach stoage cannot migrate Cannot store OS max size upto 3TB.
Persistant storge-bootable storage,can store OS on it ,network attached storage, max upto 64 TB ,Bydefault all Data is Encrypted by other cloud not have
Google charge 1 on first start after that it will chage per second

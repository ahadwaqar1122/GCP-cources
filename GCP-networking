VPC:
1: in GCP vpc is global service it means all services can communicate with private ip and in the same vpc all subnets can communicate with eachother.
2:To diff vpc can communicate with peering connections.
VPC Types:
auto-Mode
Custom-Mode
1:Auto-mode :
if we create a vpc with auto-mode it will automatically create subnets in each region.But to Auto-mode vpc can not communicate with each others because if it take same range whcih is (10.128.0.0/9) of ips meant taking same same network ip range 
due to which two diff auto-mode vpc cannot communicate with eachothers.means they cannot make pear connections.
2: Custom-Mode

3: withen the same vpc it also provide tc/udp base internal loadbalancing option.
4:One vpc can also be a part of project .
5:share pvc can also used for diff project and common host project.

MTU(maximum transmission unit): size in byt to transfer data in packets with the network or outside the network in byte is call MTU it might be 1450/1500/8896 if we want to trasfer packet faster then use 1600 data packets,
one packet consist of data headers other info default size of mtu is 1450,max is 8896

Cloud NAT gateway:
1:network Address translation is a technique that use to map the private ips of vm to NAT public facing ips that can communitate with internet,No external request can on servers,NAT gateway is like a device that 
work as NAT proxy but its by doing this due to high taffic NAT proxy cannot manage request and conguestion created to overcome this issue gcp provide a technique called SDN(software define network) which bind the
public ip and port on each vm provate ip address to communicate over the internet it is also called endromedia.
2:cloud NAT allow inboud traffic but restrict inboud traffic.
3:Cloud Nat gateway provid outboud connectivity to the following  services
1:compute engine
2:Google GKE (kubernets engine)
3:cloud run
4: CLoud function
5:App engine

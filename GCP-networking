VPC:
1: in GCP vpc is global service it means all services can communicate with private ip and in the same vpc all subnets can communicate with eachother.
2:To diff vpc can communicate with peering connections.
VPC Types:
auto-Mode
Custom-Mode
1:Auto-mode :
if we create a vpc with auto-mode it will automatically create subnets in each region.But to Auto-mode vpc can not communicate with each others because if it take same range of ips meant taking same same network ip range 
due to which two diff auto-mode vpc cannot communicate with eachothers.

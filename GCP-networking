VPC:
1: in GCP vpc is global service it means all services can communicate with private ip and in the same vpc all subnets can communicate with eachother.
2:To diff vpc can communicate with peering connections.
VPC Types:
auto-Mode
Custom-Mode
1:Auto-mode :
if we create a vpc with auto-mode it will automatically create subnets in each region.But to Auto-mode vpc can not communicate with each others because if it take same range whcih is (10.128.0.0/9) of ips meant taking same same network ip range 
due to which two diff auto-mode vpc cannot communicate with eachothers.means they cannot make pear connections.
2: Custom-Mode

3: withen the same vpc it also provide tc/udp base internal loadbalancing option.
4:One vpc can also be a part of project .
5:share pvc can also used for diff project and common host project.

MTU(maximum transmission unit): size in byt to transfer data in packets with the network or outside the network in byte is call MTU it might be 1450/1500/1890 if we want to trasfer packet faster then use 1600 data packets,
one packet consist of data headers other info default size of mtu is 1450.

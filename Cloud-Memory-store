Cloud-Memory-store:
Redis: its also part database use key value store database
in memory data store ,open source two open source cacheing service names are
Redis ,memcache.
Memory-store for Redis:
Data store in RAM .
managed service for gcp
Basic service  and standard
scaling and highly available from 99.999%
secure. we can import from on -premises to gcp redis.
google not giving any public to redis only private is giving to redis.
RAM 300 GB for each node.
Google Redis can be used with
 Google App engine
google compute Engine
google cloud functions

Read Replica Behaviours
once read replicas enabled cannot be disabled
max read replicas can have 1 to 5
read replicas limitations only 5GB instace can use for this and also its version 5 or max
full sync:
when in a case primary db cannot properly sync with read replicas then at that case it will take a snapshot and add it to the read replicas to fill the gap.
Maintenance for Redis:
we have to set the time duration for maintenance maximum time duration maintnance is one hours like free time no user request coming on the server.
Maintenance window scheuling between one week any day we can reschedule,it might be any time  or day,but  maintenance before one hour we can  rechedule.
import and export of Redis Data:
we can import or export data from on premises in (.RDB) format.
versions backward compatibility: 
yes we import data from lower version like 4.0 to higher version like 5.0 easily but we can import from higher verion of data on on-prime server to lowe version on cloud-redis.
